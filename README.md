# FakeNewsDetectionAlgorithm

### Code
There are comments to explain each line of code, and the accuracy results for the algorithm are presented for reference. For understanding of how each algorithm works, simply search the algorithm class (i.e. LogisticRegression()) on [scikit-learn website and documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html).

### Dataset
You can find the dataset that was used in this project at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/nopdev/real-and-fake-news-dataset) , which takes you to a Kaggle webpage. This was an already-built dataset by someone else.

### Resources
